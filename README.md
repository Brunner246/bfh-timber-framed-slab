# Timber Frame Construction Application

A Python application for creating timber frame floor structures with configurable beam dimensions and board thicknesses.

## Overview

This application provides a modern Tkinter UI for designing timber frame floor structures. It interfaces with a CAD software API (to be implemented by students) to create beam structures with top and bottom boards based on polygon vertices and thickness information.

## Features

- Import floor polygon data from CAD software
- Configure beam dimensions (width, height, spacing)
- Configure board thicknesses (top and bottom)
- Define element names and colors
- Generate complete floor structure with beams and boards
- Export structure back to CAD software
